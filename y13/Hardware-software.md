# Hardware and Software

A computer system is made up of **hardware** and **software**. **Hardware** refers to the physical components of a computer, which can be internal or external. Internal components include the **CPU**, **RAM**, **ROM**, **HDD/SSD**, **GPU**, and **motherboard**, while external peripherals include the **keyboard**, **mouse**, **monitor**, and **printer**. **Software** refers to the programs that run on this hardware. Most software has specific hardware requirements to run efficiently.

Software is broadly classified into **system software** and **application software**.

----------

## System Software

**System software** manages the computer’s resources and provides a platform for other programs. The most important type of system software is the **operating system (OS)**, which performs several key functions:

- **Process management** – handling multitasking and scheduling CPU time. Most OSs use **time slicing** to give each process a short turn
- **Memory management** – allocating memory to programs and preventing interference between processes.
- **Input/output (I/O) management** – communicating with peripherals using **device drivers**.
- **File management** – organizing and securing data.
- **Error detection and handling** – identifying faults and enabling recovery.
- **User interface** – providing a way for the user to interact with the system, either via a **graphical user interface (GUI)** or **command-line interface (CLI)**.

Other types of system software include:

- **Utility programs** – such as antivirus software, file compression tools, disk defragmenters, backup utilities, and encryption programs.
- **Language translators** – which convert source code into machine code. Types include:
  - **Assembler** – converts assembly language to machine code.
  - **Compiler** – translates all source code into machine code (object code) before execution.
  - **Interpreter** – executes source code line by line during runtime.
- **Library programs** – pre-written routines that can be reused by programs to save development time.

## Application Software

**Application software** allows users to complete specific tasks and can be:

- **General-purpose applications** – word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers.
- **Specialist applications** – for CAD, graphic design, or statistical analysis.
- **Bespoke software** – custom-made for a specific user or organization.
