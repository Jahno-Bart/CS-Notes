#### Barcodes

A combination of several bars that make up an individual character or digit called **symbol**

Barcode readers use light sensors to detect different intensities of light when it shines on either the black line or the white line. Then using an ADC, it is converted to digital

Barcode can be read either way - left to right or right to left
The left-hand side encoding is also the exact opposite of the right-hand side encoding
