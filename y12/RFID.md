## RFID - Radio frequence identification

IN RFID there are two different types:

- Passive RFID
- Active RFID:
  - Contains a power source, continously transmitting with a stronger signal


**How does it work:**

In **passive** the RFID tag needs to get close enough to a reader, when it does radio waves from the reader induce a current in the tag and this current is enough to power the RFID tag to transmit its unique code. The reader recieves the code and checks against a database to decide what to do. For example our studentid cards work using electromagnetic induction.

In **active** instead of drawing power from the radio waves it draws power from the battery

#### Examples:

**Passive RFID:**

- Pet microchipping
- Access control
- Smart parking lots
<br><br>

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Lower costs | Limited read range |
| Size & weight | Limited data storage |
| Longevity | Sensitivity to environmental inteference |
| No noise | Security concerns |
| Automated ||

**Active RFID:**

- Vehicle toll collection
- Real time location systems
- Inventory tracking
<br><br>

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Longer read range | Higher cost |
| Real time tracking | Limited battery size |
| Enhanced data storage | Larger in size |
| Longevity | Interference issues |
|  | Maintainance |
