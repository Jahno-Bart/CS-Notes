## Digital Images

#### Definitions:

**Battery** - Provides camera with power do to everything 

**Shutter** – Controls the time that light hits the sensor 

**Bayer filter** – Splitting the light to get the red, green , blue channels for each pixel | Filters the light captured to the human colour perceptions 

**CMOS / CCD Sensor** – Converts light into electrical charge. The more intense the light the bigger the charge. Captures light through photoelectric effect 

**ADC** –Takes a measurement of the analogue voltage and record that as a fixed binary value

#### How is a digital image stored / represented?

It is stored as a bitmap -> An image made up of pixels in which each pixel holds data for one colour block, bit-depth tells you how many colours a pixel can use. Each pixel has a red, green, blue channel.

#### What does a camera have to do to take a real scene and make it into a picture?

Push the button -> Shutter opens -> Light passes into the lens ->  Light is focused onto some sensors -> Sensors converts the light into a voltage -> ADC converts voltage into a fixed value
