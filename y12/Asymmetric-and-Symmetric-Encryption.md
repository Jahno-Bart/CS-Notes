#### Symmetric Encryption

- Same key used to decrypt and encrypt the data
- Quick
- Key exchange problem (Man in the middle attack)

#### Asymmetric Encryption [private/public key encryption]
- Uses 2 separate but related keys
- Encrypt with public key and decrypt with a private key
- Slower
- Use asymmetric to share symmetric key


#### Practice Questions
Symmetric encryption only utilises 1 key between the users to decrypt and encrypt the data whereas in asymmetric encryption two keys are used a public and private key where the public key is used to encrypt the shift number/data and private key to decrypt it. [1/1]Â 

The key exchange problem is a problem which occurs when using symmetric encryption where since there is only one key used, when its being transmitted through the internet it can be caught by a middleman which now has access to all the messages as they can decrypt them. [2/2]
