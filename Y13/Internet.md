# Internet

**What is the internet?**
The internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks. The internet facilitates a wide range of services, including the World Wide Web, email, internet telephony, and file sharing. In order to communicate to do any of those things, computers must use a common set of protocols referred to as the TCP/IP stack.

## Structure of the internet
- There were over 4.5 billion internet users as of June 2019.
- People connect to the internet using devices linked by:
    - Wireless connections (Wi‑Fi, mobile data)
    - Wired connections (cables, fibre)
- These connections feed into high‑speed telecommunication networks that span the world.  

**The Internet Backbone**
- The backbone is a mesh of ultra‑fast fibre‑optic cables and powerful industrial routers.
- It moves data extremely quickly across continents.
- Large telecommunications companies build and maintain most of this backbone.
- These companies:
    - Don’t charge each other for using the backbone.
    - Aren’t responsible for guaranteeing its availability or reliability.  


## Connecting to the internet
Your devices connect to your home hub, the hub sends your data through your ISP, and the ISP connects you to the global internet.  

Individuals and organisations access the internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your connection type depends on what your ISP offers:
- ADSL – uses your telephone line
- Fibre‑optic – a dedicated high‑speed cable
- 3G/4G/5G – mobile network connection if no cables reach your home
- Satellite – used in remote areas with no ground networks  
  
Your ISP provides a device (often called a home hub or router) that links your home network to the wider internet.
This device usually includes:
- Ethernet switch – a few ports for wired devices
- Wireless access point – provides Wi‑Fi
- Router – manages traffic going in and out of your home
- Modem – converts signals so they can travel over your connection type (sometimes built into the router)

Your mobile phone can switch between different networks without you really noticing. At home, it connects through your Wi‑Fi. At school or college, it joins their local network. When you’re out and about, it can access the internet through nearby mobile phone masts.
The connection from your home router to the internet is part of a larger network owned by your ISP. This network might cover just a town or stretch across many miles to reach rural areas, supporting anywhere from a few hundred to several thousand users.
When routers link multiple local area networks (LANs) together, the result is a wide area network (WAN). A company with several offices across a city would also be using a WAN. In the past, companies in the UK often relied on BT “leased lines,” which provided a dedicated, high‑quality connection with guaranteed bandwidth and low latency.
Today, many organisations instead connect their offices over the internet using a virtual private network (VPN). A VPN creates a secure, encrypted link across public networks, allowing devices to communicate as if they were on the same private network, while significantly reducing costs.
